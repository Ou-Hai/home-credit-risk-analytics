# Home Credit Risk Analytics

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline built on real-world financial credit data.
The objective is to support risk-based lending decisions by transforming raw, heterogeneous and noisy data into
actionable insights for financial institutions.

The project emphasizes not only predictive performance, but also data cleaning, data engineering,
economic interpretation and decision support.

## Business Context
Financial institutions face the challenge of assessing credit risk using incomplete, inconsistent
and high-dimensional data. Poor risk assessment may lead to higher default rates, financial losses
or unfair credit allocation.

This project aims to explore how data analytics and machine learning can be used to better understand
credit default risk and support more informed lending decisions.

## Business Questions
The project focuses on answering the following key business questions:

1. **Who is more likely to default on a loan?**  
   Identify borrower profiles with higher default probability based on demographic, financial
   and historical credit information.

2. **Which economic and financial variables are the most important drivers of default risk?**  
   Analyze the relative importance of income, employment, education, credit history and
   repayment behavior in explaining loan default.

3. **Are there systematic risk segments within the customer population?**  
   Investigate whether distinct risk groups exist and how they differ in terms of default rates
   and financial characteristics.

4. **How can historical credit behavior improve default prediction for new applicants?**  
   Evaluate how previous loans, repayments and credit bureau information contribute to more
   accurate risk assessment.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset, provided by a real financial institution.
The dataset consists of multiple relational tables containing:

- Applicant demographic and financial information
- Historical credit bureau records
- Previous loan applications
- Installment and repayment histories

The data reflects real-world challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formats and varying
levels of granularity across tables.

## Project Scope
The project follows a complete data analytics pipeline:

- Data ingestion and exploration
- Data quality assessment and cleaning
- Feature engineering with economic interpretation
- Relational database design and ETL
- SQL-based analytical queries
- Machine learning modeling for default prediction
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Dashboard for decision support
- API for model inference (optional, advanced)
